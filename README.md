# Tesserae

### What is it? 
Currently it's a spreadsheet where cells:
1. run user Clojure code async and in parallel
2. reactively re-run when upstream cells update
3. can run on schedule (e.g. "every 5 seconds")
4. can render hiccup and other UI elements like buttons etc.

## Demo

Run
```clojure
clojure -X:demo:dev/cljs tesserae.serve/demo
```

then visit http://localhost:3900

## Dev

Start a clojure repl with the :dev/cljs alias.
Go to `tesserae.serve`, load the file. Shadow-cljs should start up.
Run `(-main)` or `(mount/start)` to boot up the server, db, listeners etc.

## Status
Used internally in prod at [Lumber](https://lumber.dev/) but also very alpha!

## Contribute
- improve code entering experience, e.g. by adding codemirror with clojure mode
- cell functions and UI plugin system. Users should be able to extend Tesserae with their own code.
- UI additions: multiple sheets, search, users, permissions... the whole shebang!
