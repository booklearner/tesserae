# Tesserae

![screenshot](doc/img/screenshot.png)

### What is it? 
Currently, it's a spreadsheet where cells:
1. run user Clojure code async and in parallel
2. reactively re-run when upstream cells update
3. can run on schedule (e.g. "every 5 seconds")
4. can render hiccup and other UI elements like buttons etc.

## Demo

Run
```clojure
clojure -X:demo:dev/cljs tesserae.serve/demo
```

then visit http://localhost:3900

## Dev

Start a clojure repl with the :dev/cljs alias.
Go to `tesserae.serve`, load the file. Shadow-cljs should start up.
Run `(-main)` or `(mount/start)` to boot up the server, db, listeners etc.

### Extending Tesserae

**Injecting user code into the eval context:**  
Custom namespaces and bindings can be added on startup using mount args.  
The values of `namespaces` map, if they're symbols, have to be on the classpath and will automatically be required.  
The values of the `bindings` map will be required and resolved if they are fully qualified symbols
or otherwise left as their identity.  

For example:

```clojure
(-> (mount/with-args
      {:tesserae.db/dir          "folder-in-project-root/data/datalevin/db"
       :tesserae.eval/namespaces {'walk 'clojure.walk
                                  'my-ns {'my-fn (fn [x] (println :foo x))}}
       :tesserae.eval/bindings   {'println `println
                                  'debug   (fn [& args] (apply println ::dbg args))}})
    (mount/start))
```

## Status
Used internally in prod at [Lumber](https://lumber.dev/) but also very alpha!

## Contribute
- improve code entering experience, e.g. by adding codemirror with clojure mode
- cell functions and UI plugin system. Users should be able to extend Tesserae with their own code.
- UI additions: multiple sheets, search, users, permissions... the whole shebang!
